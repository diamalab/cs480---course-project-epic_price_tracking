    <h4>The store has games which have a unique name, publisher, genre, and other details associated with the game. Each publisher had published multiple games over the years. Each game might have addons like the DLC but require the base game to function. Our web scraping tool will scrape the Epic Game Store for prices weekly and record the prices for all the games and addons. Users can register for notifications from the web tool on price drops for specific games. For every time we run our web scraping tool, we compare the current price to the previous price, and notify all users who subscribed to be notified for that particular game. Our GUI tool, a web application for users to select games by publisher, genre, and view price history of the game. It will also allow users to select add-ons associated with a game and view the price history. Users will have full freedom to choose any permutation of selections for notifications on price drop.
